<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The tramp, snugly ensconced inside the truck, with the four wheels and all the framework around him, has the "cinch" on the crew--or so he thinks, until some day he rides the rods on a bad road. A bad road is usually one on which a short time previously one or several trainmen have been killed by tramps. Heaven pity the tramp who is caught "underneath" on such a road--for caught he is, though the train be going sixty miles an hour.</p><p>The "shack" (brakeman) takes a coupling-pin and a length of bell-cord to the platform in front of the truck in which the tramp is riding. The shack fastens the coupling-pin to the bell-cord, drops the former down between the platforms, and pays out the latter. The coupling-pin strikes the ties between the rails, rebounds against the bottom of the car, and again strikes the ties.</p></div> </div>
