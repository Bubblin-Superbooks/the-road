And afterward I saw men who had not sucked and who had horrible holes in their arms into which I could have thrust my fist. It was their own fault.

He was a young, manly fellow, not talkative, but very capable, indeed as splendid a fellow as one could meet with in a day's ride, and this in spite of the fact that he had just recently finished a two-year term in some Ohio penitentiary.</p><p>Hardly had we been in our cell half an hour, when a convict sauntered down the gallery and looked in.
